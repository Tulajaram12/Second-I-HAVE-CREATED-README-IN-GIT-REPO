I HAVE CREATED README IN GIT REMOTE REPO AND CLONED IN MY LOCAL UBUNTU TERMINAL 

THIS WAS DONE WITH CREATION OF SINGLE BRANCH CALLED "FEATURE BRANCH"  FROM MAIN BRANCH AND
STEPS:
1) git clone URL
2) git branch -> Master
3) git branch feature
4) git branch -> Master
                 feature
5) git checkout feature
6) vi README and edited some content
7) git add .
8) git commit -m "msg"
9) git push origin feature
BEFORE RAISING MERGE REQUEST TO MASTER SO I WILL DO FOLLOWING STEPS:
10) git checkout master
11) vi README 
12) git add .
13) git commit -m "msg"
14) git push origin main
15) NOW RAISE THE MR TO main branch FROM feature branch and check WHETHER MERGE CONFLICTS HAPPENS OR NOT
